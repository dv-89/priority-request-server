Design and implement a request server that accepts requests. Each request that comes in has a randomly generated priority, 1 being the highest, and 5 being the lowest, and a randomly generated time-to-process between 1 and 5 seconds. The server can only process one request at a time. All requests are generated before the server can start processing them.

The program should support multiple servers!

Example output:

Enter number of requests: 10
Enter number of servers: 3
Enter maximum processing time per request: 5
Received request 1(5,4) // 1 = request id, 5 = priority, 4 = time to process
Server 0 added 1(5,4)
Server 0 requests: 1(5,4),
Received request 2(1,3)
Server 1 added 2(1,3)
Server 1 requests: 2(1,3),
Received request 3(5,5)
Server 2 added 3(5,5)
Server 2 requests: 3(5,5),
Received request 4(2,1)
Server 0 added 4(2,1)
Server 0 requests: 4(2,1),1(5,4),
Received request 5(2,3)
Server 1 added 5(2,3)
Server 1 requests: 2(1,3),5(2,3),
Received request 6(1,2)
Server 2 added 6(1,2)
Server 2 requests: 6(1,2),3(5,5),
Received request 7(5,1)
Server 0 added 7(5,1)
Server 0 requests: 4(2,1),7(5,1),1(5,4),
Received request 8(3,5)
Server 1 added 8(3,5)
Server 1 requests: 2(1,3),5(2,3),8(3,5),
Received request 9(3,2)
Server 2 added 9(3,2)
Server 2 requests: 6(1,2),9(3,2),3(5,5),
Received request 10(1,3)
Server 0 added 10(1,3)
Server 0 requests: 10(1,3),4(2,1),7(5,1),1(5,4),
Server 1 processing request 2(1,3)
Server 0 processing request 10(1,3)
Server 2 processing request 6(1,2)
Server 2 processing request 9(3,2)
Server 1 processing request 5(2,3)
Server 0 processing request 4(2,1)
Server 0 processing request 7(5,1)
Server 2 processing request 3(5,5)
Server 0 processing request 1(5,4)
Server 1 processing request 8(3,5)
